        <p>The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at 
            elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). It is solitary and gathers only in mating 
            seasons. It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and uses scent marks as 
            chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Females rear cubs for an average 
            of 18 to 24 months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.

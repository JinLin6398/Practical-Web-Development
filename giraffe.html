            Giraffes are the tallest land animals, easily recognizable by their long necks and distinctive spotted coats. 
            Native to Africa, they primarily inhabit savannas and open woodlands, where they feed on the leaves of acacia trees and other tall vegetation.
            Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. To help them while being prayed upon they will run at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour.
            Their hide feet are brought in front of the forelegs in a gallop that helps them cover enormous distances. 
            Giraffes origins trace back millions of years to a group of animals known as Giraffidae, which also includes their closest living relative, the okapi. 
            These ancestors evolved in Africa and Eurasia, with fossil evidence suggesting that early giraffe-like creatures roamed the continent during the Miocene Epoch, around 20 million years ago.

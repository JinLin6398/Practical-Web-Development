            Giraffes are the tallest land animals, easily recognizable by their long necks and distinctive spotted coats. 
            Native to Africa, they mainly live in savannas and open woodlands, where they feed on the leaves of acacia trees and other tall vegetation.
            Lions, leopards, hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. To help them when they are being prayed upon they will run at a speed of up to 35 miles per hour.
            They are able to achieve this speed by bringing their hide feet in front of the forelegs in a gallop that helps them cover bigger distances. 
            Giraffes origins trace back millions of years to a group of animals known as Giraffidae, which also includes their closest living relative, the okapi. 
            These ancestors evolved in Africa and Eurasia, with fossil evidence suggesting that early giraffe-like creatures roamed the continent during the Miocene Epoch, around 20 million years ago.

        <p>
            Snub-nosed monkeys live in Asia, with a range covering southern China 
            (especially Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou) extending into the northern parts 
            of Myanmar and Vietnam. Snub-nosed monkeys inhabit mountain forests up to elevations 
            of more than 4,000 m (13,000 ft). In the winter, they move into the deeply secluded 
            regions.

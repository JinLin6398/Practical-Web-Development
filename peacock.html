            Peacocks are one of the most beautiful birds, known for the vibrant, colorful tail feathers of the males, which they fan out and display to attract mates. 
            Only the male is called a "peacock," while the female is referred to as a "peahen." If you aren't sure on which it is then they are known as peafowl. 
            Native to South Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka, peafowl are admired for their beauty and have been symbolically significant in various cultures. 
            While the males are known for their colorful and vibrant plumage, females have more subdued colors allowing them to blend into their surroundings and protect their nests. 
            Peafowl are social birds that can often be found in groups, grazing on seeds, insects, and small creatures.

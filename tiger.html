        <p>The Siberian tiger or Amur tiger is a population of the tiger subspecies Panthera 
            tigris tigris native to the Russian Far East, Northeast China[1] and possibly North 
            Korea.[2] It once ranged throughout the Korean Peninsula, but currently inhabits 
            mainly the Sikhote-Alin mountain region in southwest Primorye Province in the Russian 
            Far East. In 2005, there were 331â€“393 adult and subadult Siberian tigers in this 
            region, with a breeding adult population of about 250 individuals.

            A black panther is the melanistic colour variant of the leopard. 
            Frequency of melanism appears to be approximately 11% over the leopard's range. 
            Data on the distribution of leopard populations indicates that melanism occurs in 
            five subspecies in the wild: the Indian leopard, Javan leopard, African leopard, 
            Indochinese leopard (P. p. delacouri) and Sri Lankan leopard (P. p. kotiya). 
            Based on records from camera traps, melanistic leopards occur foremost in tropical 
            and subtropical moist broadleaf forests.

            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and 
            India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and 
            a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions 
            are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming 
            groups called prides.

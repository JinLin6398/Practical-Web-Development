            Sea lions are sleek and agile marine mammals known for their playful behavior and intelligence. 
            They can be found in both the Pacific and Southern Oceans, they are members of the pinniped family which also includes seals and walruses. 
            Unlike seals, sea lions have external ear flaps and can use their strong front flippers to "walk" on land, giving them greater mobility when out of the water. 
            They are often seen as social animals since they like to gather in large colonies on beaches or rocky shores, where they rest, mate, and raise their young. 
            Sea lions are powerful swimmers, capable of reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour to help them hunt for fish, squid, and other prey.

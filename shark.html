            Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, 
            five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head.
            The earliest confirmed modern sharks (selachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic around 200 million years ago, 
            with the oldest known member being Agaleus, though records of true sharks may extend back as far as the Permian.
            They are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft).

            Flamingo or flamingoes are a type of wading bird in the family Phoenicopteridae, 
            which is the only extant family in the order Phoenicopteriformes. There are four flamingo species 
            distributed throughout the Americas (including the Caribbean), and two species native to Afro-Eurasia.
            A group of flamingoes is called a "flamboyance". The name flamingo comes from Portuguese or Spanish flamengo 
            'flame-colored'.

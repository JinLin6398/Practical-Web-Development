            Elephants are the largest living land animals. Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa,
            South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, 
            and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, 
            due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a fission-fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together 
            to socialise.
